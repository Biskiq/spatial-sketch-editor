# T1.P01.S01 — acceptance record: Shared interface providers

**Slice:** T1.P01.S01 · **Status:** implemented — **no acceptance recorded**; independent review owed ·
**Plan:** [implementation-plan.md](./implementation-plan.md) (owns the criteria) · **Phase:** [T1.P01](../README.md)

No acceptance is claimed. This record carries the implementer's evidence so the reviewer can verify
it; the verdict, the tested-revision confirmation and any gate promotion belong to that review, not
to the implementation diff. The register's `ratified` F1/F3 rows state interface ratification, never
implementation or acceptance.

## Implementation evidence (implementer-reported — not acceptance)

Delivered on base `main` @ `aeb464b2` (PR #125, including merged PR #124), branch
`T1-P1-S1-implementation`. The evidence below was produced on a clean tree at that revision plus this
diff; a later edit invalidates the rows it touches.

| Surface | Delivered in |
| --- | --- |
| `F1.reference@1` (`references-v1`) exports | `packages/project-model/src/references/` (shapes, strict validation, resolver host + resolution, frame resolution, generation-qualified correspondence, stable ID ordering) |
| `F3.channels@1` (`inspection-v1`) exports | `packages/project-model/src/channels/` (address/descriptor/typed values, the two v1 families, negotiation, the Camera-output ticket protocol) |
| F1 conformance | `apps/editor/tests/lib/project-model/references-conformance.test.ts` — 19 cases |
| F3 conformance | `apps/editor/tests/lib/project-model/channels-conformance.test.ts` — 23 cases |
| Accepted-capabilities / Requires enforcement | `capabilityProblems` + the register fields in `apps/editor/tests/docs/parallel-track-gates.test.ts` |
| Runtime-safe import direction | `apps/editor/tests/lib/project-model-boundary.test.ts` (arch lane) walks every file in the package |

npm run test:api              node --test (real Postgres)   39 tests, 0 skipped, 0 failed    PASS
```

The API is not edited by this slice, but it imports `@portfolio/project-model` (`validateProject`,
`ProjectDocument`, `SceneDocument`, publication persistence), so §7.4's API rows were run rather
than assumed: `apps/api` type-checks and its DB-backed suite passed against a reachable local
Postgres with **zero skips**, so the publication and auth paths actually executed. Whitespace
(`git diff --check` against base `aeb464b2`, staged/unstaged and worktree) is clean.

## Scope actually delivered

- Domain-qualified identity, revision, frame and channel addressing with strict validation (unknown
  keys, empty identities, non-finite numbers and unsupported versions reject).
- Typed resolution through one registered resolver per authority: `resolved` with the canonical
  subject, its concrete revision and its owner, or `missing | removed | incompatible | unauthorized |
  repair-required` with repair actions offered and no repair performed as a read effect. Resolution
  is evaluated against one supplied accepted snapshot; there is no ambient latest, and no name,
  label, index or proximity fallback exists in the interface.
- `project-lock` revision resolves only through an admitted F.2 lock reader; with none supplied it
  is `incompatible` and no lock is manufactured.
- Generation-qualified correspondence: fragments are runtime-only, expire on recompile, and
  selection keeps the canonical source.
- Frame qualification: `project-world` resolves to the project origin datum; an owner-qualified
  frame without an authored source refuses, and no centroid, nearest Room or containment invents one.
- Channel address/descriptor/typed value family, the Layout ordinary Plan and Camera session
  inspection families, and negotiation: exclusive conflict rejection with domain/address/owners and
  an actionable reason, same-invocation deliberate replacement, ordered replacement per run epoch,
  set union over declared identities, staleness rejection on a declared invalidation input, and
  depth-absence reported as an unsatisfied family rather than an evaluated inspection.
- AM-3's Camera-output ticket protocol as interface and negotiation behaviour: `{outputId,
  sourceRevision, sessionEpoch, ownerId, runEpoch}`, one exclusive owner per viewport/session,
  acquire/request/replace/return/cancel, return validating the current source/output context, and
  stale owner/epoch rejection — no runtime, evaluator, output controller, projection or navigation.
- Accepted-capabilities / Requires enforcement: the two register fields, the closure walk, the
  trusted-base requirement, retirement ineligibility, self-satisfaction refusal and
  historical-evidence reporting.

## Boundary the implementation keeps

Layout, Scene and read-only Camera **subject resolution** attaches later through the same resolver
host, owned by each authority; AM-1 scopes this gate to the common interface and the registry
admission rules, so the conformance fixtures register test-only resolvers. No Stage, live Camera
controller, local F4 acceptance/history, source migration or downstream slice behaviour is
implemented, and no cycle window is opened (S01 is not a listed exposure).

## Owed to review (not implementer judgement)

- The independent verdict against the plan's acceptance criteria, and the tested-revision
  confirmation.
- Whether to promote `F1.reference@1` and `F3.channels@1` to `implemented` (exports + conformance
  paths) and `accepted` (acceptance record + ancestor commit), and to record the
  `F1.reference@1:references-v1` / `F3.channels@1:inspection-v1` Accepted-capabilities entries.
  Until that happens both rows stay `ratified` with empty evidence columns and no consumer may
  Require either scope.
- Any residual risk the review finds in the recorded contracts.

The record is filled against the plan's acceptance criteria by the reviewer once real code and a
run exist, following the evidence convention in
[`apps/editor/tests/README.md`](../../../../../apps/editor/tests/README.md) and the
[T1 runbook](../../../../operations/t1-spatial-world/README.md): implementation → review →
acceptance → routine closeout → merge.
