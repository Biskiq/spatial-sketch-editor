/**
 * Test-owned verdicts for the P23B fixture set.
 *
 * These are the deterministic expectations the suite pins for every fixture the
 * builders in `./p23b-fixtures.ts` can construct: the canonical serialization
 * identity (sha256 of the canonical Layout JSON), the document shape, and the
 * shipped codec/topology/compiler verdict.
 *
 * The values were transcribed from the P23B measurement ledger document under
 * the P23B roadmap when the suite stopped reading it (plan §7.6 area 4) — the 12
 * `canonicalSha256` digests excepted, because the format-6 cutover re-shaped what
 * they hash; see the note at the end of this header — so that
 * its measurement provenance — machine, browser session, sampling, commit, date
 * and the class/role bookkeeping that belongs to a recorded measurement — is no
 * longer part of any test. WP4 may now delete that document, and no test under
 * `apps/editor/tests` reads it.
 *
 * The ledger held a 16th row, the retired `owner-40-curved-v1` owner payload. It
 * has no builder here (see `P23B_RETIRED_OWNER_FIXTURE_ID`), so it is
 * deliberately absent: it is historical identity, never a live fixture
 * expectation.
 *
 * T1.P02.S01 — FORMAT 6 DIGEST RE-DERIVATION (2026-10-22). Format 6 removed the
 * authored Wall `role`, so every fixture's canonical serialization changed shape
 * and its `canonicalSha256` no longer equals the ledger's value. Each of the 12
 * digests was re-derived at the cutover from
 * `serializeWallFirstLayoutDocument` over the format-6 fixture; the suite pins
 * that equality, so the digest is a serialization identity of the current
 * document, not an independent record of what the code decides. The deliberate
 * scope of the re-derivation: `shape`, `topology` and `compilerIssues` are still
 * the ledger's transcriptions, unchanged, and they remain the behavioural
 * expectations. A digest is expected to move with a format that changes the
 * serialized fields; a shape, topology or issue-code move is a finding.
 *
 * C2 FORMAT 7 RE-DERIVATION (2026-11-09). The closed-Wall schema bump changes
 * the serialized `formatVersion`, so every canonical digest moved. Each value
 * below was re-derived from `serializeWallFirstLayoutDocument` at format 7;
 * shape, topology and compiler issue expectations are unchanged.
